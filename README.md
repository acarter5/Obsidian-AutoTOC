# AutoToc

This is a plugin for Obsidian that creates an editable table of contents for your notes.

# Usage

Place an `autotoc` code snipet in the directory you would like to create a table of contents in

````
```autotoc
```
````

In reading mode, the file will display a table of contents that defaults to ordering folders and files in the order they were created.

You can change the order of any item in the table of contents by clicking it and dragging it to the desired position.

New files and folders will be added to the table of contents when you create them!
